Container — A way to package applications portably with all necessary dependencies and configurations, which makes development and deployment easier.

Where do they live? — Docker Hub, container repositories (public and private).

Before containers:

1. Every developer needed to install application-specific versions.
2. Installation processes varied on each OS environment, so developers had to face more errors.

After containers:

1. Only one Docker command is needed to fetch and run the whole container.
2. No dependency or server configuration is needed except for docker runtime
