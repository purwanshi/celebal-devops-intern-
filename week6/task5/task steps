name-Configure liveliness and readiness probes for pods in AKS cluster.

Liveness Probe	Checks if the container is alive and running. If not, Kubernetes restarts it.
Readiness Probe	Checks if the container is ready to serve traffic. If not, the pod is temporarily removed from the service endpoint.

Probe Mechanisms:
HTTP GET	request --->httpGet: { path: /, port: 80 }
TCP Socket check---->	tcpSocket: { port: 80 }
Exec Command test --->	exec: { command: ["cat", "/tmp/healthy"] }

steps-
1.apply deployement.yaml to AKS
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

2.kubectl get pods
3.kubectl  describe  pod <pod-name>

4.confirm probe effect
kubectl  exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/sh

TCP-SOCKET-PROBE
same steps
It tries to open a TCP connection to port 80.
If it succeeds — probe passes.
If it fails (no listener / blocked port) — liveness restarts the pod, readiness removes it from endpoints.

EXEC COMMAND PROBE
It tries to open a TCP connection to port 80.
If it succeeds — probe passes.
If it fails (no listener / blocked port) — liveness restarts the pod, readiness removes it from endpoints.

apply first four steps and 
create files-
touch /tmp/healthy
touch /tmp/ready
