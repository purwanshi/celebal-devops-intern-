name=Create and attach persistent volume claims to pods.

Persistent Volume (PV)	A cluster-wide storage resource (provisioned statically or dynamically)
Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)	A request for storage by a pod
The PVC is attached to the pod, and it binds to a PV behind the scenes


task steps-
1.create a PVC
2.create pod that uses the PVC

3.create pvc.yaml
Requests 1Gi of storage
Allows a single pod to read/write (ReadWriteOnce)
Uses the default StorageClass of your AKS cluster (which provisions Azure Disk automatically)

4.create pod-using-pvc.yaml
Attaches volume named demo-volume to /usr/share/nginx/html in the container
The volume is backed by the PVC mypvc

5.create PVC
kubectl apply -f pvc.yaml
kubectl get pvc it should say bound

6.create pod
kubectl apply -fpod-using-pvc.yaml
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe pod pvc-demo-pod

7.confirm the volume inside pool ,access pod shell
kubectl exec -it pvc-demo-pod -- /bin/bash

8.check mounted volume
df -h
ls /usr/share/nginx/html
