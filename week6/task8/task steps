name=Configure health probes for pods.

Probe Type-
Liveness Probe	Checks if the container is still running. If not, restarts it.	During pod lifetime
Readiness Probe	Checks if the container is ready to receive traffic. If not, removes from Service endpoint list.	Before sending traffic
Startup Probe	Used for slow-starting apps. Runs on startup. Only after it succeeds, the other probes start running.

steps
1.configure health-probe.yaml
Field	
livenessProbe	Hits / at port 80 every 5 seconds after 10 sec delay. If it fails 3 times, pod restarts.
readinessProbe	Hits / at port 80 every 5 seconds after 5 sec delay. If it fails 2 times, removes pod from endpoints.
startupProbe	Runs cat /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html. If this succeeds, the other probes start. Else, it retries 30 times every 5 seconds.


2. kubectl apply -f health-probe.yaml
3.kubectl get pods
4.kubectl describe pod health-probe-demo
5.kubectl exec -it health-probe-demo -- /bin/bash

6.remove /usr/share/nginx/html/inde.html to stimulate startup probe failure
rm /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html

7.kubectl get pods
